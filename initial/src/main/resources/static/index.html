Static resources, like HTML or JavaScript or CSS, can easily be served from your Spring Boot application just be
dropping them into the right place in the source code. By default Spring Boot serves static content from resources in
the classpath at "/static" (or "/public"). The index.html resource is special because it is used as a "welcome page"
if it exists, which means it will be served up as the root resource, i.e. at http://localhost:8080/ in our example.
